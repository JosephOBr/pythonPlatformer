1 demonstrate movement and refresh
	- gameloop will constantly refresh character, may optimise this so
	  that a character will not refresh if it has not moved
		- Suggestion, to update character if the key has been pressed
		  or if character has velocity
	- key presses will move the character

	addForceFuncion takes a list of vector forces as input and outputs the
fundamental
	
	BEGIN program
		running
		WHILE running
			IF key_pressed
				playerForceArray = playerForceArray + new
forcdwe
			END IF
